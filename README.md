# Future Work üèóÔ∏è

### Resource Management with Membership and Roles

### 1. User Membership

- **Church Membership**: A user can belong to one or more churches. Membership is managed through a join table that links users to churches.
- **Ministry Membership**: A user can belong to one or more ministries within a church. This is also managed through a join table linking users to ministries.

### 2. Resource Ownership

- **Church Resources**: Resources are owned by churches. If a resource is associated with a church, it is available to be managed by users who are members of that church.
- **Ministry Resources**: Resources can also be specifically owned by ministries within a church. Users must be members of both the church and the specific ministry to manage these resources.

### 3. Permissions

- **Managing Church Resources**: A user can manage resources owned by a church if they are a member of that church. The system checks the user‚Äôs church memberships to grant or deny access.
- **Managing Ministry Resources**: A user can manage resources owned by a ministry if they are a member of both the church and the specific ministry. The system verifies both memberships before allowing access to ministry-specific resources.

## Example Scenarios

1. **User A** is a member of Church X and has access to resources owned by Church X. They will be able to manage those resources as long as they are part of Church X.
2. **User B** is a member of Church X and Ministry Y within Church X. They can manage resources owned by both Church X and Ministry Y. If a resource is specific to Ministry Y, User B can manage it because they are a member of both the church and the ministry.
3. **User C** is a member of Church X but not of any ministries within Church X. They can manage resources owned by Church X, but they cannot manage resources that are specific to any ministries within Church X.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Models

- **Church**: Has many resources, has many ministries, has many users through a join table.
- **Ministry**: Belongs to a church, has many resources, has many users through a join table.
- **User**: Belongs to many churches, belongs to many ministries, can manage resources based on their memberships.
- **Resource**: Belongs to a church, optionally belongs to a ministry.

### 2. Controllers and Views

- Implement logic in your controllers to check if the current user is a member of the church or ministry that owns the resource before allowing them to perform actions.
- Provide appropriate UI feedback to users about which resources they can manage based on their memberships.

### 3. Authorization

- Use role-based authorization or a gem like Pundit to enforce permissions based on user memberships.
